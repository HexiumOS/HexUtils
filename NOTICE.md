This utility package aims to provide a partial or complete port of the [coreutils suite](https://www.gnu.org/savannah-checkouts/gnu/coreutils/coreutils.html), alongside custom programs not included in the original collection.

The port is implemented as a ground-up rewrite using the Rust programming language, prioritizing safety and performance.

Program names have been retained to ensure familiarity and facilitate seamless migration from GNU/Linux environments.

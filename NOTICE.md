> [!IMPORTANT]
> This utility package is an attempt to port a part/most/all of [coreutils](https://www.gnu.org/savannah-checkouts/gnu/coreutils/coreutils.html).
> The porting is achieved by a ground-up rewrite in the Rust programming language.
> Program names are reused to maintain familiarity and ease of migration from GNU/Linux distributions.
